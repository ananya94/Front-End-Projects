        <p>Diane Stefani obtained a favorable decision on a dispositive motion on behalf of a School District. 
        Diane Stefani recently obtained a favorable court decision on a dispositive motion in Cook County on behalf of a School District. Multiple plaintiffs had filed a multi-count complaint alleging sexual assault and abuse by a defendant teacher and various theories attempting to implicate the District. This motion to dismiss was brought early in litigation, and resulted in a dismissal of the counts against the School District, with prejudice, prior to any discovery.</p><br>

        <p>Patrick Hess and Matthew Cohen settle automatic sprinkler system failure claim 
        Patrick Hess and Matthew Cohen recently settled a case involving the failure of an automatic sprinkler system to respond to a devastating fire at a Michigan recycling facility. Our client insured that publically-owned facility and paid more than $7,600,000 for the fire damages. On behalf of our client, Mr. Hess and Mr. Cohen filed suit against two fire protection contractors alleging that they had negligently inspected and serviced the sprinkler system before the fire. Mr. Hess and Mr. Cohen took more than 50 depositions in the case including seven defense experts. After extensive discovery, they obtained a settlement for our client. The terms of that settlement are confidential by agreement with the defendants. </p>
